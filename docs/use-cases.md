# Use Cases

## Embedded Streaming
Shig enables livestreaming directly from PeerTube without the need to configure OBS or transfer streaming secret keys to another software.
There is a PeerTube plugin for this purpose.
With the plugin, a Shig service can be registered, allowing Shig to call the Instance Actor and follow the instance.
Since both PeerTube and Shig have ActivityPub integration, Shig can retrieve information about the peerTube instance and  live videos.
This enables embedded streaming, meaning no other software is necessary.

## Multi Guest Streaming

With Shig you can invite other PeerTube users to join the stream.
